# Daily Tech Progress

Welcome to Daily Tech Progress! This repository serves as a journal to track my daily development tasks, learning endeavors, and project advancements. Each day, I document my activities to monitor progress and share insights into my coding journey.

## Purpose

This repository aims to:

- Document daily development tasks and learning goals.
- Track progress in mastering new technologies and tools.
- Share insights and lessons learned along the way.

## Structure

- Monthly Logs: Tasks are organized by month for easy navigation and tracking.
  - Each day's tasks are documented in markdown files named by date (e.g., 2024/07/06.md for July 6th, 2024).

## Explanation:

- **Tasks Completed**: Each section (`Learn React Context API`, `Deploy a Static Site to AWS`, etc.) lists tasks that were completed with checkboxes (`[x]`) marked for completed tasks.
- **Incomplete Tasks**: Section specifically for tasks that were not completed, including a reason for each task (e.g., ran out of time).
- **Reflections**: Optional section for reflecting on the day's progress, challenges faced, and areas for improvement.

This structure helps you keep track of what was achieved, what remains to be done, and provides context for any incomplete tasks. Adjust the reflections and reasons based on your actual progress and experiences throughout the day.
