### Reflections
- Today was productive with significant progress made on multiple fronts. 
- The React Context API tasks went smoothly, and the AWS deployment was completed successfully, including setting up Route 53. 
- Figma tasks were enjoyable and efficient. 
- However, I couldn't complete the hands-on project for React Context API and the Vim skills enhancement due to time constraints. 
- The optional task on JavaScript getters and setters also remains incomplete.
- Tomorrow, I will prioritize these unfinished tasks to ensure steady progress.
